Hi, Wes here! :wave:

I've been a self-taught programmer since the 90s, a professional since 2006, and a consultant/freelancer since 2009. [Ruby](https://github.com/ruby) has been my main language for 16+ years, and I still love it. I've done some [Elixir](https://github.com/elixir-lang) projects as well. Like every web developer I speak Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, etc. As a fullstack developer who strongly focused on the backend, it's my preference to stay away from them when possible. ðŸ™ƒ

Most of my code is hidden away in (clients') private repositories, but when possible I make open source contributions.

I'm available as consultant via my [website](https://www.narnach.com) and offer Ruby on Rails maintenance services via [RoRMaaS](https://www.rormaas.com).

Things I'm interested in (as a person, so a mix of personal and professional):

- Software quality, testing, maintenance/maintainability, stability, documentation
- Gaming, Artificial Intelligence, simulations, system dynamics
- Entrepreneurship, ethical business principles, work/life balance, sustainability, pragmatic ethics

You can reach me by [email](mailto:wes@narnach.com) or in context in other places.
